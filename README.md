## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project outlines a structured approach to requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**. It simulates a real-world development scenario, focusing on accurately capturing, documenting, and organizing requirements to serve as a solid foundation for software design and implementation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a core phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders define what the system should do. It involves gathering, analyzing, and refining requirements to ensure everyone shares a common understanding of the system‚Äôs goals and behavior.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

* **Clarity & Communication:** Minimizes ambiguity among stakeholders.
* **Defines Scope:** Prevents uncontrolled feature expansion (scope creep).
* **Guides Design:** Serves as a blueprint for development.
* **Estimates Cost & Time:** Enables accurate resource planning.
* **Improves Quality:** Ensures the final product meets expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è

* **Interviews:** Direct stakeholder discussions.
* **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Broad input from users.
* **Workshops:** Collaborative sessions.
* **Observation:** Understand user workflows.
* **Document Analysis:** Study existing systems and records.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è

* **Brainstorming:** Generate ideas.
* **Focus Groups:** In-depth discussions.
* **Prototyping:** Visual representations to refine needs.

### 3. Requirement Documentation üìö

* **Specifications:** Formal listing of all requirements.
* **User Stories:** Describe features from the user's view.
* **Use Cases:** Diagrams showing user-system interactions.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä

* **Prioritization:** Identify critical vs. optional features.
* **Feasibility:** Assess technical, financial, and time constraints.
* **Modeling:** Visual tools like data flow or ER diagrams.

### 5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ

* **Review & Approval:** Verify with stakeholders.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Define when a requirement is met.
* **Traceability:** Ensure all requirements are tracked through development.
